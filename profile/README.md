# SIDPT Workgoup

Welcome to the Supporting Inclusive Digital Publishing through Training (SIDPT) project workgroup github.

The aim of the SIDPT strategic partnership was and is to promote the creation and distribution of accessible publications by providing practical training material for professionals working in the publishing ecosystem.
The learning material is developed by project partners [BrailleNet](https://www.braillenet.org/) (France), [Dedicon](https://www.dedicon.nl/) (The Netherlands) and [Johannes Kepler Universit√§t](https://www.jku.at/) (Austria).

The project was a strategic partnership co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.
