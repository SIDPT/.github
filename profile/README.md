# SIDPT Workgoup

Welcome to the github page of the Supporting Inclusive Digital Publishing through Training (SIDPT) project.

The aim of the SIDPT strategic partnership was and is to promote the creation and distribution of accessible publications by providing practical training material for professionals working in the publishing ecosystem.
The learning material is developed by project partners [BrailleNet](https://www.braillenet.org/) (France), [Dedicon](https://www.dedicon.nl/) (The Netherlands) and [Johannes Kepler Universit√§t](https://www.jku.at/) (Austria).


This content is distributed using a [fork of the Claroline LMS](https://github.com/SIDPT/Claroline), deployed on JKU premises at https://ipip.integriert-studieren.jku.at/ .
The code of the platform is managed by the workgroup along several plugins for it.


The project was a strategic partnership co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.
